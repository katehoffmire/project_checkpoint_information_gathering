	<h1>Research</h1>

	<p>I have been involved in the market research and consumer insights space for a little over a decade now. In that time I have presented at conferences, ran webinars, and published some of my research. </p>

	<p>Woring with Brandwatch and the non-profit Ditch the Label, I was able to lead the research and analysis on two projects during December 2021 on hate speech during the COVID pandemic as well as a report on serephobia for World Aids Day 2021.</p>
