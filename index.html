		<p>
			My name is Kate Hoffmire and I am a first year MSI student focusing on UX. 
			I returned to school after a ten year career working in market research and 
			consumer insights for a handful of SaaS companies. My undergraduate is from 
			BYU and is in Middle Eastern History and I minored in communications which 
			drove my first internships and jobs in marketing and market research. I still 
			work as a research freelancer for the last company I worked for as it is a great 
			school job to compliment a graduate schedule.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my career I have worked as a consumer insights researcher driven to help 
			companies learn from quantitative and qualitative data to improve their customer 
			experience. At Brandwatch, I lead a team of researchers managing the design of 
			research methodology, data analysis, insights storytelling, and client consultation 
			on how to use consumer intelligence to make strategic decisions.
